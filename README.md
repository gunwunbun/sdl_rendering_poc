# SDL Rendering - proof of concept

## Introduction
This proof of concept C++ project contains a small app that renders 
objects to a window.
The UI aspect is done by a little "framework", providing an interface with some basic UI tasks. 
The implementation can easily be swapped out for something else, in this case SDL2 is implemented.
